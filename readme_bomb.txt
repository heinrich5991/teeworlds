bomb mod
by Somerunce
ported by heinrich5991
----------------------------
This is the Teeworlds modification called bomb.
It's a hammer-only game mode with one player selected to be the bomb.
There's a timer counting down from 19 to 0, and when it hits the bottom
the bomb explodes. During the time, the bomb can hit other players with
his hammer. This make them change roles, and so the new player become
the bomb. The other players can hammer at the bomb to gain points and
lower the timer with 1 second/hit, or hit each other, making the input
freeze for one second for the player you hit.

When the bomb explodes, a new player is selected to be the bomb, and the
count is restarted. When there's just one last player left, the round is
over.

You gain score by hammering and hitting people.
